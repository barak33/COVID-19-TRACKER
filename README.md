# COVID-19-TRACKER

The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker you’ve built can serve multiple objectives, including:

1. Real-Time Monitoring
Provides instant updates on COVID-19 case trends across different countries.

Helps users track current infections, recoveries, and death rates.

2. Data Analysis & Decision Support
Enables researchers and policymakers to analyze trends for better response strategies.

Businesses and governments can use the data to make informed decisions about lockdowns, travel restrictions, and healthcare planning.

3. Public Awareness & Education
Offers interactive visualizations to help users understand the spread of COVID-19.

Encourages people to stay informed about vaccination rates and health guidelines.

4. Healthcare Resource Allocation
Helps healthcare systems determine resource needs based on case surges in different locations.

Allows hospitals and governments to plan vaccination campaigns more effectively.

5. Historical Data Comparison
Combines historical and real-time data to analyze patterns over time.

Helps in studying the effectiveness of interventions, such as lockdowns and vaccinations.

6. Customizable Insights
Users can filter data by country, time period, or specific metrics.

Provides a foundation for further enhancements, like forecasting models or AI-driven insights.

# HOW TO RUN
To run and view Live COVID-19 Global Data Tracker, follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your Environment
Make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib requests streamlit
2. Run the Script (Basic Console View)
If you want to preview data in the terminal, simply run:

bash
python your_script.py
This will process your CSV file (owid-covid-data.csv), fetch real-time data, and display basic statistics.

3. Launch the Web Dashboard (Streamlit)
If you've integrated a web interface using Streamlit, start the app by running:

bash
streamlit run your_script.py
Once executed, Streamlit will generate a local web server and provide a link (e.g., http://localhost:8501). Open this link in your browser to view interactive charts, metrics, and country-based data.

4. Deploy the Tracker Online
To make your tracker accessible worldwide, consider deploying it on:

Streamlit Cloud (streamlit.io)
